# Hill Climbing Algorithm for Eight Queens Problem
## AIM

To develop a code to solve eight queens problem using the hill-climbing algorithm.

## THEORY
To implement Hill Climbing Algorithm for 8 queens problem

## DESIGN STEPS:
 
### STEP 1:
Import the necessary libraries

### STEP 2:
Define the Intial State and calculate the objective function for that given state
### STEP 3:
Make a decision whether to change the state with a smaller objective function value, or stay in the current state.
### STEP 4:
Repeat the process until the total number of attacks, or the Objective function, is zero.
### STEP 5:
Display the necessary states and the time taken.
